# Description: This program reads files containing actor I.D's and names, movie 
# I.D's and names, and movie I.D's to actor I.D's and maps each actor I.D. to 
# thier name, each movie I.D. to thier name, and then maps each actor to what 
# movie they appeared in. Then the program builds a graph connecting all actors 
# together via the movie they appeared in. That graph is then ran though a BFS 
# algorithm, building a shortest path graph to Kevin Bacon.
